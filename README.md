This is a project to complete the assignments in [The Elements Of Computing
Systems](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) using haskell, as well as to reproduce
some of the simulator software included with the book as command line friendly
utilities also written in haskell.

I'm doing this firstly as a practice exercise for haskell, as the assignemnts
are very fun and are not too complex yet not too simple either, and secondly to
go through the book with my wife, who is using it to learn programming and
computer science.

So, if you are my wife or anybody else doing TECS, stop looking at the
solutions because it's cheating :D
